fakeDB
======

Mimiking the basic functionality of a table-based database while storing all data in a text file. This is for fun and not recommended to actual use.
Unless you like text files with easily alterable data (security is horrific).

And FYI, you MUST *.save() your database when you are done processing it, otherwise it will not write to the file.
